## 🚗 Collision Avoidance System Using CAN Protocol

### 📌 Introduction

This project implements a **Collision Avoidance System** using the **CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol** on an **STM32 microcontroller**. It improves vehicle safety by allowing multiple ECUs (Electronic Control Units) to communicate and respond to potential collision threats using sensor data.

🚦 **Why CAN?**
CAN is widely used in the automotive industry due to:

* 🛡️ High noise immunity & error detection
* 📶 Efficient, message-based multi-node communication
* ⚡ Real-time performance
* 🧩 Simple wiring and scalability

---

### 🧠 System Overview

Each node performs the following:

* 📡 Monitors surroundings using **ultrasonic** and **IR sensors**
* 🧠 Processes local sensor data (e.g., distance, proximity)
* 📤 Sends CAN messages to other nodes on risk detection
* 📥 Receives data from peers and takes preventive action
* 🚨 Triggers alerts (buzzer/LED) on detecting a collision risk
